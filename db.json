      "description": "Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.[8] While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.[9] Humankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final destination; to the 21st century when aircraft allows travel from Spain to the United States overnight.",

      "description": "Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel safety.[16] When traveling abroad, the odds favor a safe and incident-free trip, however, travelers can be subject to difficulties, crime and violence.[17] Some safety considerations include being aware of one's surroundings,[16] avoiding being the target of a crime,[16] leaving copies of one's passport and itinerary information with trusted people,[16] obtaining medical insurance valid in the country being visited[16] and registering with one's national embassy when arriving in a foreign country.[16] Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries; however most countries accept international driving permits.[18] Automobile insurance policies issued in one's own country are often invalid in foreign countries, and it is often a requirement to obtain temporary auto insurance valid in the country being visited.[18] It is also advisable to become oriented with the driving rules and regulations of destination countries.[18] Wearing a seat belt is highly advisable for safety reasons; many countries have penalties for violating seatbelt laws.",
